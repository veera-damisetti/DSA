'''

Given two numbers, num1 and num2, represented by linked lists of size n and m respectively. The task is to return a linked list that represents the sum of these two numbers.

For example, the number 190 will be represented by the linked list, 1->9->0->null, similarly 25 by 2->5->null. Sum of these two numbers is 190 + 25 = 215, which will be represented by 2->1->5->null. You are required to return the head of the linked list 2->1->5->null.

Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists, but there should not be any leading zeros in the output list.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 2
num1 = 45 (4->5->null)
m = 3
num2 = 345 (3->4->5->null)
Output: 
3->9->0->null  
Explanation: 
For the given two linked list (4 5) and (3 4 5), after adding the two linked list resultant linked list will be (3 9 0).
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
num1 = 0063 (0->0->6->3->null)
m = 2
num2 = 07 (0->7->null)
Output: 
7->0->null
Explanation: 
For the given two linked list (0 0 6 3) and (0 7), after adding the two linked list resultant linked list will be (7 0).
