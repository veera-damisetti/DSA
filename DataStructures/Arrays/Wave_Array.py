'''
Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....

If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Note:The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to make changes in the original array itself.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 2 1 4 3 5
Explanation: Array elements after 
sorting it in wave form are 
2 1 4 3 5.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 6
arr[] = {2,4,7,8,9,10}
Output: 4 2 8 7 10 9
Explanation: Array elements after 
sorting it in wave form are 
4 2 8 7 10 9.

            a[i],a[i+1]=a[i+1],a[i]
