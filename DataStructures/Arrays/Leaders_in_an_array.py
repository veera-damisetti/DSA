'''
Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array. An element of array is a leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader. 

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
Output: 17 5 2
Explanation: The first leader is 17 
as it is greater than all the elements
to its right.  Similarly, the next 
leader is 5. The right most element 
is always a leader so it is also 
included.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,4,0}
Output: 4 0
Explanation: 0 is the rightmost element
and 4 is the only element which is greater
than all the elements to its right.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function leader() which takes array A and n as input parameters and returns an array of leaders in order of their appearance.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 107
0 <= Ai <= 107



Approach: 

- Traverse the array from backwards
- Keep the current maximum value in max variable 
- if an element is greater than or equal to the current maximum , then it will a leader :)

    #Function to find the leaders in the array.

            if A[i]>max:
                max = A[i]
            if A[i]>=max:
                res.insert(0,A[i])
        
            
        return res
